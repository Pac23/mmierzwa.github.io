My name is Marek Mierzwa. I'm a husband, father, spiritual journeyman, and in meantime a software developer. Speaking of the last one I spent most of the time coding in backends,
working with enterprise search systems and in general - designing and implementing distributed architectures. If you are interested more in some of the details of my professional life see my
[LinkedIn profile]({{site.social.linkedin}}).
