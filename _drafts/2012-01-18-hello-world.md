Welcome on my new blog (and also the first one).<br />In few days I plan to picture some of my first experiences with development in SharePoint 2010. They are related with my current project - custom upload form with <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/silverlight/radupload-overview.html" target="_blank">Telerik upload control</a> (Silverlight) that will entirely replace the standard OOB upload mechanism for custom document libraries.
